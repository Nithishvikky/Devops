## ðŸ“Œ Realistic Timeline
This depends on your **background** (IT/Software/Networking). Letâ€™s assume youâ€™re starting fresh but want a DevOps-oriented path:

1. **AWS Cloud Basics** (CCP level) â†’ **2â€“4 weeks**  
   - Learn fundamentals, services overview, billing model.

2. **Hands-on Practice** (EC2, S3, VPC, IAM) â†’ **1â€“2 months**  
   - Try deploying apps, hosting websites, setting IAM policies.

3. **DevOps Essentials on AWS** â†’ **1â€“2 months**  
   - Practice CI/CD pipelines, Docker + ECS/EKS, Infrastructure as Code.

4. **1x AWS Certification (Associate level)** â†’ **~3â€“4 months total prep**  
   - Most DevOps people aim for:  
     - **AWS Solutions Architect â€“ Associate** (best foundation), or  
     - **AWS Developer â€“ Associate**, then later  
     - **AWS DevOps Engineer â€“ Professional**.  

ðŸ‘‰ So, realistically: **3â€“4 months** (with 8â€“10 hrs/week) to get to your **first AWS cert** if you stay consistent.
